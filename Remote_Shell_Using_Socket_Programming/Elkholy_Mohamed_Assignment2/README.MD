# REMOTE SHELL USING SOCKET PROGRAMMING

This program contains a custom remote shell server and client implementation in C. The server allows clients to connect and execute shell commands remotely.


# Features

- Allows multiple clients (10 max) to connect simultaneously.
- Executes command at Server side successfully and return the result to client.
- Logs client IP and port information when they connect.


# Building

To compile the server and client programs, follow these steps:

- Use the command "make" to run the makefile and complie the server and client.


# Usage:

1. Run the server on your host using "./server", so the server will start listening on port 9090.
2. On a different terminal, run the client program using "./client".
3. You can run multiple clients if needed.
4. You'll be prompted to enter a shell command: "Enter the shell command (or 'quit' to exit):"
5. Enter a shell command (e.g., ls or date) and press Enter to execute it on the server.
6. To exit the client, enter the command "quit".
